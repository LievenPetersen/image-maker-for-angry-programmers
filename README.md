# basic pixel art tool

The idea is to provide a simple image making tool with relatively short loading times for slow potatoes.

- uses raylib + raygui
- all dependencies are included
- to build:
  - `make`: build with provided raylib version.
  - use `make build_from_global` to use globally installed raylib version.
- to run: `make run` or `./imfap`

---

- supported formats: `.png` `.bmp` `.qoi` `.raw (rgba)`
- can load image from command line argument


## preconfigured for ease of use:
